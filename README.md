# Hacking-simulator
This is an incremental game created by Me, "The-MathsMaster" or DankDystopia. This game is heavily based on Antimatter Dimensions, a great game by Hevipelle that you should check out [here]("https://IvarK.github.io").

This is a WIP and there are many more new features to be added in the fture, including a new prestige layer "Matrix", more options and a news ticker.
